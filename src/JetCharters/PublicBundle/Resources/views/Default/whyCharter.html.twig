                    <h3>Commercial Air Travel vs. Flying Private </h3>
                    There are a number of options available when making air travel plans. Commercial air travel is often the most obvious choice for some travelers, but flying private via jet charters is a means of travel that should not be overlooked. 
                    <br/>
                    There are many reasons to choose private aviation for your air travel needs. In fact, the many benefits of private aviation far outweigh those associated with commercial air travel.  
                    <br/>
                    In recent years, commercial air travel has become an increasingly complicated process. Due to heightened security measures, commercial passengers are often required to arrive several hours prior to their flights. 
                    <br/>
                    Whether standing in a security line or waiting for a connection flight, even a short-distance trip via a commercial airline can require a significant time investment on the part of the traveler. 
                    <br/>
                    Not only does commercial air travel force passengers to waste valuable time waiting, there are also many restrictions placed upon luggage and packed items. 
                    <br/>
                    With only around 500 airports served by U.S. commercial airlines, options for commercial air travel are limited. The economic downturn of recent years has resulted in commercial airline cutbacks, which indirectly causes flights to be cancelled or at the very least, crowded and uncomfortable. 
                    <br/>
                    There’s nothing worse than planning a trip only to have to spend precious time waiting for flights, changing itineraries or cancelling plans altogether. 
                    <br/>
                    Alternately, private air travel has only gotten more accessible through the years. Flying via private jet charters, whether for business or leisure travel, affords passengers a greater number of options while saving valuable time. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Flying Privately Saves Valuable Time and Promotes Efficiency</h3>
                    Time is especially important in the world of business and a businessperson’s time is quite possibly his or her most valuable commodity. 
                    <br/>
                    Probably the most significant benefit for flying private is the time passengers can save in doing so. When a passenger flies private, he or she can arrive at the airport just minutes prior to his scheduled departure time. 
                    <br/>
                    Private aviation travelers also experience the benefit of a non-stop, direct route to travel destinations, as opposed to spending time stuck trying to make connecting flights, layovers, etc. 
                    <br/>
                    Additionally, flying private means having more productive time while onboard the aircraft. Since travel schedules are optimized for efficiency and private aircraft cabins are configured in a way that is conducive to working, private passengers can get more work done in-flight. 
                    <br/>
                    According to a recent study, some private passengers believe they are more productive on company aircraft than at the office because distractions are minimized. 
                    <br/>
                    Business aircraft passengers can take the time they need both in-flight and on the ground to communicate and engage with customers. Not wasting time means business professionals are able to get more accomplished and be more successful. 
                    <br/>
                    Other examples of efficiency demonstrated by companies using business aircraft are outperformance in annual earnings growth, stock and dividend growth and market capitalization. Studies show that businesses using private aviation provide a greater ROI to shareholders than ones in a similar industry that do not. 
                    <br/>
                    Often, business travelers need to transport tools, equipment or materials for business purposes, but these necessities can be in direct conflict with airline carry-on or luggage regulations. 
                    <br/>
                    Even if these items are in line with commercial airline regulations, there is always a chance that luggage contents can be lost or damaged in-flight. 
                    <br/>
                    Flying private allows business travelers to be more efficient since they can carry what they need directly onto their flights. Because of this, the chance of having luggage lost or damaged on private flights is practically non-existent. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Private Aviation Strengthens Global Business Relationships</h3>
                    Forming relationships is an important aspect of any business and flying privately allows for greater opportunities to do this as well. Now that business is carried out on a global scale, there is a greater need to establish and foster long-distance business relationships. 
                    <br/>
                    Technology has allowed businesses to be more connected, but often there is nothing like meeting in person to create professional rapport. Many business dealings involve delicate situations that must be handled carefully and confidentially. 
                    <br/>
                    When a group of colleagues is traveling together on a chartered flight, they can feel confident that they will be able to speak about private business matters without risk of having it overheard. This could not be achieved on a commercial flight.
                    <br/>
                    Sometimes there is a need to meet with clients or colleagues in different locations in a single day. Business aviation allows for more opportunities to meet face-to-face with colleagues and customers around the globe. 
                    <br/>
                    Business aviation creates a way for a greater amount of business to take place at a more efficient level unlike commercial air travel ever could. Private aviation strengthens business objectives and allows industries to grow and thrive. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Private Aviation is a Reliable Mode of Transportation</h3>
                    Approximately 3% of all commercial airline flights are cancelled. However, almost a quarter more than that experience delays. Commercial flight cancellations and delays can cause travelers to miss their connections. 
                    <br/>
                    Missed connections are a headache that private aviation passengers will never have to deal with. When traveling via private charter, there is rarely a need for a connecting flight. In the case that there is, your flight will wait for you. What are the odds of that happening with a commercial flight? 
                    <br/>
                    Another issue that can arise with commercial air travel comes from the fact that some airports and airlines have low frequency flights. This means if a commercial flight is cancelled, passengers have little or no options to get where they need to go in the desire timeframe. With private aviation, these types of concerns over delays or cancelations are virtually nonexistent. 
                    <br/>
                    There are many options for private jet charter, one of which being on-demand air charter. Further contributing to the reliability of private aviation, on-demand charter is popular among companies and provides instant access to business aircraft at a moment’s notice. 
                    <br/>
                    An important part of reliability, with regard to private aviation travel, is safety. A commitment to safety and security is paramount when it comes to the private aviation industry. 
                    <br/>
                    Business aircraft operators currently participate in a variety of voluntary programs designed to enhance safety and security and the industry has achieved a safety record comparable to that of major commercial airlines.  
                    <br/>
                    Since 9/11, the business aviation industry has worked alongside government officials to implement security measures and practices to reduce opportunities for safety threats. The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has even stated that general aviation does not present serious homeland security vulnerability. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Private Aviation Offers Flexibility</h3>
                    Flexibility is another key benefit of private aviation. The option to use smaller, less congested airfields located in closer proximity to a final destination is a big part of this. 
                    <br/>
                    A way that private air travel provides travelers more flexible travel is with an increased number of points of departure and arrival. While commercial airlines in the U.S. only serve 500 airports, private aviation allows passengers more than 5,000 airport options. 
                    <br/>
                    Often, travelers need to reach smaller communities with little or no airline service. Private aviation makes travel to these locations, as well as metropolitan cities and remote areas, possible. 
                    <br/>
                    In fact, according to the results of a study published by the NBAA, more than 60% of business respondents named efficient schedules and the ability to reach remote locations as a benefit of private aviation.  
                    <br/>
                    Flexibility with private aviation travel also comes in the form of being able to reach multiple destinations quickly and efficiently. Business travelers frequently need to visit several cities in a single day for meetings and other business engagements. 
                    <br/>
                    Private aviation is practically the only mode of transportation that allows businesses to have these types of schedule possibilities. It’s even possible to change flight plans in mid-flight if necessary. 
                    <br/>
                    Another indirect benefit to the flexible scheduling and ease of access to meeting locations for business travelers is being able to minimize time spent away from home and the office. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Flying Private is More Enjoyable </h3>
                    Not only does private air travel afford passengers more travel options, but the experience of traveling via private charter is more enjoyable than commercial airline travel. 
                    <br/>
                    Private aircraft offer luxury furnishings and plenty of space, as opposed to crowded commercial flights. Flying via private air charter also means you will have a dedicated crew and staff who are committed to your comfort both pre-flight and during. This individualized attention is another key benefit to flying privately. 
                    <br/>
                    Airline food has long been seen as undesirable where its quality and taste is concerned. When you book a flight via private jet charters, you often have the ability to choose preferred food and beverage options in advance. This only makes the private flying experience more enjoyable. 
                    <br/>
                    Dealing with long lines and crowds typically associated with commercial flying can be stressful. Waiting for a flight, losing your luggage, and being concerned about possible delays can cause major headaches for commercial air passengers. Flying privately means not having to deal with any of these issues, which makes for a much more enjoyable travel experience. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Private Aviation is Environmentally Friendly</h3>
                    Of all transportation emissions, aviation emissions make up only a tiny fraction of the total. Business aircraft emissions make up a small amount of those, giving it a small carbon footprint. Also, business aviation as an industry has a noted environmental record. 
                    <br/>
                    One significant step by the NBAA was the creation of the Environmental Issues Strategic Action Plan. In the past several years, the association has made progress by implementing a sustainable management system as well as making recommendations on practices to its members about reducing fuel burn and emissions. The NBAA has conducted surveys to determine how its members are adhering to best practices. 
                    <br/>
                    Through the forming of industry alliances, the NBAA is able to work with the General Aviation Manufacturers Association and the International Business Aviation Council. There is a strong commitment to technology that can minimize noise and emissions while at the same time serving to improve the safety and efficiency standards within the industry.  
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>Private Aviation Creates Jobs</h3>
                    Another important benefit to the private/business aviation industry is that it strengthens our national economy. Not only does business aviation create jobs for more than 1.2 million people, it also contributes $150 billion to our national economic output. 
                    <br/>
                    One reason for this is that the majority of general aviation aircraft used for business purposes around the world are manufactured, operated, and maintained in America. Aircraft manufactured elsewhere are often outfitted with U.S.A.-made electronics, engines, interiors and other systems. 
                    <br/>
                    The 1.2 million people who are employed by the business aviation industry include professionals such as pilots, maintenance technicians, dispatchers, flight attendants, airport employees and other support staffers. 
                    <br/>
                    Each state in the U.S. reaps financial benefits of the general aviation activities of sales, maintenance and support through other operations. This serves to stimulate economic growth and development for our entire nation.
